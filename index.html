    <h2>Welcome To My Wepage, My Name is Iveth Dominguez!</h2>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at the University of Oregon, 
        with minors in Creative Writing and Mathematics. This combination allows me to explore both the 
        logical structure of code and the expressive power of language. </p> 
    <p> Alongside my studies, I work as a writing tutor at the university’s Tutoring and Academic Engagement 
        Center, where I support students in developing their writing skills across various disciplines. I’ve also served as 
        a peer mentor for the Pathway Oregon Scholarship Program, guiding first-year students through their transition 
        into college life and helping them find community on campus. </p>
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy reading and 
        writing poetry across a range of styles and voices. I’m especially passionate about making computer science 
        more accessible to students from all backgrounds, regardless of their prior experience. I believe that access 
        to education empowers younger generations to learn, grow, and shape the future. </p>

    <h3>Current Project</h3>
    <h4>FocusHut</h4>
    <p>
      Students can choose between two study methods: The Pomodoro Technique or The Feynman Technique. Both of the study 
      methods will use a timer which allocates a certain amount of time to studying a particular topic. If students choose 
      the Feynman Technique, they will be encouraged to write what they have learned into a simple and concise paragraph. 
      Along with these two study methods, FocusHut will contain soothing graphics to provide a calm study environment. 
      FocusHut will also provide relaxing background music to reduce the stress students may feel as they study.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far we have implemented a tasks class which converts the tasks into a dictionary which contains their id, name, category, 
      and completion status. We also are able to keep track of them through a JSON file which holds their status and information. 
      The program so far is able to ask for user input by giving them four options to choose from. We have also looked into Tkinter 
      for the GUI aspect of our project since we aren’t familiar with it. We also discussed possible ways to organize our GitHub to 
      separate our classes from our main function.
